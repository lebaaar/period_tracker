  Period tracking mobile app I built for my girlfriend. She needed a simple app to track her period cycle without all the annoying ads and premium subscription offers. Requires no internet access, all data is stored on device.
</div>

## Features
- Effortless cycle logging with a clean, easy-to-use design
- Insights - average cycle and average period length
- Dynamic period prediction: smartly adjusts based on past cycles
- Static mode: set a fixed period & cycle duration for consistent tracking
- Customizable reminders: get notified n days before your period starts
- Offline data transfer between devices
- Easter eggs :)

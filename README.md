Period tracker mobile app I built for my girlfriend. She needed a simple app to track her period cycle without all the annoying ads and premium subscription offers.


## Features
- Track period cycles  
Intuitive, simple, beautiful UI
- Insights page  
Stay on track average with period and cycle length
- Dynamic period prediction  
App can either work in *Dynamic period prediction* mode where app tries to predict the next period date based on previous entries or in *Static mode*, where user inputs her period duration.
- Notifications n days prior to period start  
Configurable in settings
